## Business Problem Overview

Recognizing the need for fairness and transparency, introduced a novel bidding system to the Facebook Marketplace. This system allows users to engage in competitive bidding, enabling market dynamics to dictate reasonable prices. These enhancements are expected to draw more users to the platform, enhance fairness, and potentially boost revenue for Facebook.

## Business Rules

- A `User` is a Facebook user.
- A user can be a seller or a buyer.
- A user can publish multiple ads. The publisher of an ad is the seller.
- A user can bid on multiple ads. The bidder of an ad is the buyer.
- A user can receive multiple alerts on interested bids and the ad whenever state changes.
- A user can have watchlists on multiple Ads.
- A user can give feedbacks after the purchase.
- A user can give mulitple feedbacks on multiple ads.
- A user can have multiple chats with the buyers.
- A seller can block multiple buyers.
- A buyer can report on multiple ads.
- A buyer/seller can raise multiple complaints.
- An Ad can have multiple bids.
- An Ad can have multiple views.
- An Ad can have multiple reports.
- An Ad can have multiple watchlists.
- An Ad must be mapped to exactly one Auction.
- Every Ad has status. Like, Active, Sold, Withdrawn, etc,
- An Ad must have Reserve Price, Buy Now Price (max price).
- Buyers can bid only on Active Ads and the bid price must be between reserve price and buy now price.
- A bid must have a status. Like, Active, Won, Lost, etc.
- The seller must set the auction period at the time of ad posting.
- The seller can also set the auto extension of the auction period if there are no bids on the ad.
- The seller can also set the minimum bid increment. The minimum bid increment is the minimum amount that a buyer can bid on the item.
- The seller can also set the buy now price on the auction. The buy now price is the price at which the seller is willing to sell the item immediately.
- The buynow price is always greater than the reserve price.
- The buyer cannot bid the amount greater than the buynow price.
- If the buyer bids the buy now price, the auction ends immediately.
- An admin can remove the ad if the ad is reported by the buyer and if the admin finds the ad is violating the Facebook policies.
