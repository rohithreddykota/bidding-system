Specific objects to be reflected in the code include the database, tables, data types, primary and foreign keys, and views, stored procedure, triggers, UDFs etc. 


Each team is expected to create the following database objects:

at least 3 stored procedures containing input and output parameters
at least 3 views (often used for reporting purposes).
At least 1 DML trigger
at least 3 Table-level CHECK Constraints
Computed Columns based on a user defined function (UDF)
Column Data Encryption
at least 3 non-clustered indexes
Power BI /Tableau for data visualization
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for CRUD operations a plus (optional)
Submission instruction:

1. Please create a summary sheet from this sample: P4_Cover_sheet.docx
2. Please upload the following on Drive/Github and make the URL " public viewable " and share the URLs as Summary sheet (pdf ) on Canvas
Your summary sheet should include following links :
 (please note if your URL is not publicly accessible, if TA fails to open them for some rights, you will lose marks)

• 1 .sql file containing all DDLs for all database objects created.
• 1 .sql containing insert statements for data population
• A zipped file containing files used for data visualization report or dashboard, or GUI
