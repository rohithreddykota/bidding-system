## Business Problem Overview

Recognizing the need for fairness and transparency, introduced a novel bidding system to the Facebook Marketplace. This system allows users to engage in competitive bidding, enabling market dynamics to dictate reasonable prices. These enhancements are expected to draw more users to the platform, enhance fairness, and potentially boost revenue for Facebook.

> Note: The primary focus of the project revolves around the bidding system itself. It does not involve the handling of funds between buyers and sellers. Instead, the emphasis is placed on creating a fair and transparent bidding process.
